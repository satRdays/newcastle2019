description: "In a world where we are all supposed to live and breath coding/analysis/development, be self-taught, and be ever-improving, it can be hard to justify just having some fun with it all, for no purpose whatsoever. Even more, it can be hard to justify not wanting (or being able) to have anything to do with it outside of work. In this talk Iâ€™ll try to give you a reason for just fooling around (besides it being funny and all), as well as remove your guilt of having better things than coding to do in your spare time."
